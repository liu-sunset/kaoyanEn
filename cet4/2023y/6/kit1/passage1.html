        The United States is facing a housing crisis. Affordable housing is inadequate, while luxury homes
        abound (充裕), and homelessness remains a persistent problem. Despite this, popular culture and the
        housing industry market happiness as living with both more space and more amenities (便利设施). Big
        houses are advertized as a reward for hard work and diligence, turning housing from a basic necessity into
        a luxury.
        This is reflected in our homes. The average single-family home built in the United States before 1970
        was less than 1,500 square feet in size. By 2016, the average size of a new, single-family home was 2,422
        square feet. What's more, homes built in the 2000s were more likely than earlier models to have more of
        all types of spaces; bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, recreation rooms and garages.
        There are consequences of living big. As middle-class houses have grown larger, two things have
        happened. First, large houses take time to maintain, so cleaners and other low-wage service workers are
        required to keep these houses in order. Second, once-public spaces, where people from diverse
        backgrounds used to come together, have increasingly become privatized, leading to a reduction in the
        number of public facilities available to all, and a reduced quality of life for many. Take swimming pools.
        While in 1950, only 2,500 U.S. families owned pools, by 1999 this number was 4 million. At the same
        time, public municipal pools were often closed, leaving low-income people nowhere to swim.
        The trend for bigger housing thus poses ethical questions. Should Americans accept a system in which
        the middle and upper classes enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, using the low-wage labor of others? Are we willing
        to accept a system in which an increase in amenities purchased by the affluent means a reduction in
        amenities for the poor?

        I believe neither is acceptable. We must change the way we think; living well does not need to mean having more private spaces; instead, it could mean having more public spaces. A better goal than building bigger houses for some is to create more publicly accessible spaces and amenities for all.

        46. What are big houses promoted to be in the United States?
